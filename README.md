## Problem Set 2
Problem Set 2.3 code is labeled "Learning.cpp"
Future problem sets will be labeled by the [setNumber].[sectionNumber].[problemNumber] format.  There is not problem set 1 as I am not taking this class through MIT but doing it through MIT Opencourseward.  As such I felt no need to go back through the most basic aspects of C++.

## Array_Play.cpp
This file uses an array to store values 33 through 126 and then displays both the integer value and the character from the ASCII table.

## Set2.4.1_6.cpp
Includes problem 5.1 to 5.5.  This program approximates the value of pi using an area formula and pseudo-random number generation.
