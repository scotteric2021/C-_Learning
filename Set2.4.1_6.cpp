/*4.2
Explain why, given your functions from part 1, sum(1, 10.0) is a syntax error. (Hint: Think
about promotion and demotion â€“ the conversion of arguments between types in a function
call. Remember that the compiler converts between numerical types for you if necessary.) [1
point] 
*/

/* sum(1, 10.0) would be a syntax error in the above functions because the first number given is an integer,
while the second is a floating point number.  The compiler would promote the integer to a float to match the second
unless it was defined as a double.  My program has a way around this by defining both inputs as doubles.
If the integer version was used then the output would only show the truncated integer version of the addition.

/* 4.3
Write 2 more functions such that you can find the sum of anywhere between 2 and 4 integers
by writing sum(num1, num2, ...).

/* 4.4
Now write just one function that, using default arguments, allows you to take the sum of
anywhere between 2 and 4 integers. What would happen if you put both this definition and
your 3-argument function from part 3 into the same file, and called sum(3, 5, 7)? Why?

int sum(const int x, const int y, const int z = 0, const int a = 0)
{
    return (x + y + z + a);
}

The compiler would be confused by the call to multiple funtions named "sum".  The names of the individual
funtions must be differentiated.  Hence "sum", "sum3" and "sum4"

use to represent an arbitrarily large set of integers in two arguments?)
